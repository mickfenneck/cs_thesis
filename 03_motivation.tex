Before the project, only 1.62\% of Italian companies had a Facebook Page/User associated in Atoka Index. The previous knowledge about facebook pages/user was collected analyzing the content of companies' official websites but was clearly not enough for a business product that aims to connect companies to new business customers.

The subset chosen is interesting to study because many restaurant, pubs and companies involved in the food sector:

\begin{itemize}
\item have a Facebook Page, or user created erroneously instead of a business page (now Facebook has built a tool that migrates a business user account to a formal Facebook page but not all the companies have used it so far).
\item still don't have a website: this is a really fundamental task to improve contacts in Atoka and a great reason to find how many of them really have a Facebook Page.
\end{itemize}

Another interesting part of the problem is how to sample a training dataset for the classifier. In fact, as said before, there are only few companies with ATECO n.56 connected to a website and this implies that less of them have a Facebook page/user connected. The number of matched Facebook pages is 6,355, over a dataset of 362,154 companies with ATECO n.56, less than 2\% of them.

The result that this project will produce will be used to upgrade Atoka index data and, in consequence, data available on the online Atoka lead generation platform.
