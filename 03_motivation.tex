When it comes to lead generation, one of the main important aspects is to give to the service users the more way it can get to connect with potential customers. Most of the companies collected in the Atoka index have, apart from their Name, a complete field of legal address, sometimes the phone number (of the legal location) but they didn't have a lot of "modern communication" fields like email, website and, most of all, social media. 
These are some of the last statistics about the impact of Facebook\cite{fbstats}
\begin{itemize}
\item Worldwide, there are over 1.71 billion monthly active Facebook users (Facebook MAUs) which is a 15 percent increase year over year. (Source: Facebook as of 7/27/16) What this means for you: In case you had any lingering doubts, statistically, Facebook is too big to ignore.
\item 4.5 billion likes generated daily as of May 2013 which is a 67 percent increase from August 2012 (Source: Facebook)
\item 1.13 billion people log onto Facebook daily active users (Facebook DAU) for June 2016, which represents a 17\% increase year over year (Source: Facebook as 7/27/16) The Implication: A huge and vastly growing number of Facebook users are active and consistent in their visits to the site, making them a promising audience for your marketing efforts.
\item There are 1.57 billion mobile active users (Mobile Facebook MAU) for June 2016 (Source: Facebook as of 7/27/16) an increase of 20 percent year-over-year.  There are 1.03 billion Mobile Daily Active Users (Facebook DAU) for June 2016 which is an increase of 22\% year-over-year.
\item On average, the Like and Share Buttons are viewed across almost 10 million websites daily. (Source: Facebook as of 10/2/2014)
\item In Europe, over 307 million people are on Facebook. (Source: Search Engine Journal) The Takeaway: This isn't just a U.S. phenomenon - a worldwide market is available via Facebook.
\end{itemize}

Before the project, only 1.62\% of Italian companies had a Facebook Page/User associated in Atoka Index.
Having the company's facebook page linked to their account on Atoka became soon a priority for Spaziodati, that decided to invest in this project. The previous knowledge about Facebook pages/user was collected analyzing the content of companies' official websites but was clearly not enough for a business product that aims to connect companies to new business customers. However, the mining of the website data was one of the most influent project over this research and the team adopted an approach very similar to the one used before.

As introduced in the previous chapter the subset chosen is the ATECO 56. This subset of companies is interesting to study because many restaurant, pubs and companies involved in the food sector:

\begin{itemize}
\item have a Facebook Page, or user created erroneously instead of a business page (now Facebook has built a tool that migrates a business user account to a formal Facebook page but not all the companies have used it so far).
\item still don't have a website: this is a really fundamental task to improve contacts in Atoka and a great reason to find how many of them really have a Facebook Page.
\end{itemize}

Another interesting part of the problem is how to sample a training dataset for the classifier. In fact, as said before, there are only few companies with ATECO n.56 connected to a website and this implies that less of them have a Facebook page/user connected. The number of matched Facebook pages is 6,355, over a dataset of 362,154 companies with ATECO n.56, less than 2\% of them. This is one of the main reasons of why the approach that have been choses was Random Forest.

The result that this project will produce were used to upgrade Atoka index data and, in consequence, data available on the online Atoka lead generation platform.
